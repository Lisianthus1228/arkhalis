# Arkhalis Collector
My first attempt at an incremental game, and my first real introduction to javascript. The "buildings" and resource(s) are Terraria-themed 
but thats pretty much it. I primarily used [dhmstark's guide](https://kastark.co.uk/articles/incrementals.html) to help make a majority of the game.

Play it [here](https://lisianthus1228.github.io/lisianthus/).
To start off click the spinning arkhalis to get the main currency.
